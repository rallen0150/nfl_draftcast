# nfl_draftcast

During the 2017 NFL Draft I was inspired to see if I can build my own DraftCast. I have the application working to where it auto refreshes on its own every 2 and a half minutes. I wanted to do this on my own to rework a web scraping application and doing one assignment like that on something that I care about. It is a basic web scraping application that scrapes from ESPN.


### How it works:
* This is a web scraping application.
* **nfl_draftcast** scrapes the ESPN website and pulls the draftees in order from their site.
* I put the information that the program gathers into a table to make it a little more presentable.
* You can select whatever round you want to and it will show the correct data.
* **nfl_draftcast** auto updates every 2 and a half minutes.
  * If there is a trade, the DraftCast will show the correct logo for whoever drafts that player.
